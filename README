The idea is to build a SQL engine using Python. 

I want to implement the basic SQL commands, both DDL (CREATE TABLE) and DQL (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE)
I will need a lexer to parse the SQL script (I'd like to make an interactive shell as well), and return the relevant information or create new objects.
The idea for now is to represent tables as instances of a dataclass
